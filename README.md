# MachineLearning

Explored and visualized several datasets using pandas, seaborn, plotly, and cufflinks (however, iplots don't show on github).


Trained and tested various models/classifiers including:
  
  unsupervised: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNearestNeighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines 
  
  supervised: K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis


Performed Natural Language Processing work using the natural language processing toolkit. 


Created artificial and deep neural networks using tensorflow and saved the details of the neural network onto a file using tensorboard.
